Hello, welcome to our experiment!

In this experiment, you will hear segments from four fiction stories.
The stories are read by synthesized voices, like myself.

You will hear three different synthesized voices, who will take it in turns to say a few paragraphs at a time.
Your goal is to pay attention to the stories and try to fully follow what is going on in the story.
